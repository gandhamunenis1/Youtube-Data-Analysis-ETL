🎥 Data Engineering YouTube Analysis Project
🌟 Overview
This project aims to analyze trending YouTube videos by processing structured and semi-structured data. The goal is to derive valuable insights into the metrics like views, likes, dislikes, and comments of videos across multiple regions, leveraging AWS technologies for scalability and efficient analysis.

🎯 Project Goals
🔄 Data Ingestion: Ingest raw data from multiple sources into the cloud.

🔧 ETL System: Transform raw data into a clean, structured format for analysis.

🏞 Data Lake: Centralized storage (S3) to manage and store both raw and processed data.

📈 Scalability: Build a scalable pipeline to handle increasing data volume.

☁️ Cloud Integration: Utilize AWS cloud services for large-scale data processing.

📊 Reporting & Visualization: Build dashboards and reports to analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.

⚙️ Technologies & Services Used
🗃️ Amazon S3: Scalable object storage service for storing raw and processed data.

🔑 AWS IAM: Manage access securely to AWS resources.
